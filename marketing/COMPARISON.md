## Why Savvy Wins

1.  **Context**: Competitors only hear audio. Savvy **sees** your screen. It knows you are looking at a Python error or a Q3 financial report.
2.  **Privacy**: Otter/Fireflies record everything to their servers to train their models. Savvy uses **your** API keys, so your data privacy is governed by OpenAI/Anthropic's strict enterprise policies, not ours.
3.  **Invisibility**: No "Savvy Bot" joins your delicate client calls. It listens from your system audio, totally undetectable.
