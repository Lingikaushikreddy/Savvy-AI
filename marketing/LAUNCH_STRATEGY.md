## 🛡️ Contingency Plans

### Scenario A: Server/API Crash
*   **Action**: Switch to "Maintenance Mode" on landing page.
*   **Comms**: Tweet transparency update immediately. "We're growing too fast, upgrading servers."

### Scenario B: Critical Bug Found
*   **Action**: Rollback to last stable version if possible.
*   **Fix**: Hotfix immediately, push update via auto-updater.

### Scenario C: Low Traction
*   **Action**: Repost with different angle (e.g., pivot from "Meeting Assistant" to "Coding Companion").
*   **Ads**: Consider small ad spend on Twitter/Reddit to boost initial visibility.
