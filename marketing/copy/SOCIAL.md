**Tagline**: Undetectable AI assistant for meetings and interviews.
**Links**: https://savvy-ai.com

### Description (Short)
Stop frantically taking notes. Savvy AI is the invisible desktop assistant that listens to your meetings, understands your screen context, and provides real-time answers and summaries. It's like having a senior engineer whispering solutions in your ear.

### Description (Long)
Hi Hunters! 👋

I'm Kaushik, creator of Savvy AI.

We've all been there:
- Stumbling during a technical interview because you blanked on a concept.
- Losing focus in a 2-hour meeting and missing the action items.
- Manually taking screenshots of code errors to paste into ChatGPT.

**Savvy AI solves this.** It's a native desktop overlay that sees what you see and hears what you hear.

**Key Features:**
👀 **Contextual Vision**: Instant answers based on your screen content (VS Code, Docs, Browser).
👂 **Invisible Intelligence**: Real-time transcription and answer generation during calls.
📝 **Auto-Notes**: Meeting summaries, action items, and email drafts generated automatically.
⚡ **Native Speed**: 720p optimized capture and local shortcuts for zero-latency workflows.

It's "Augmented Reality" for your desktop work.

We're offering **50% OFF** for the Product Hunt community today with code `PHLAUNCH`.

### First Comment
"Maker here! 🛠️

I built Savvy AI because I hated the context switching between my work and ChatGPT. I wanted something that felt integrated into my OS.

I'm hanging out here all day to answer questions. Specifically interested in:
1. What integrations would you like to see next? (Notion/Jira?)
2. How do you currently handle meeting notes?

Thanks for checking it out!"

**Stop taking meeting notes.**

Seriously. In 2025, if you are still manually typing action items, you are working too hard.

Introducing **Savvy AI** – your intelligent desktop co-pilot.

Unlike browser extensions that only work in Chrome, Savvy is a **native app**. It works across Zoom, Teams, VS Code, and any other tool you use.

🚀 **Highlights:**
- **Contextual Vision**: It sees your screen errors and suggests fixes.
- **Live Assistance**: Get answers to questions asked during calls instantly.
- **Privacy Core**: Bring your own API keys.

I built this to solve my own problem of "context switching fatigue."
